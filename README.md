# ThoughtCatcher6 - AI-Enhanced Mind Mapping Application

## 🧠 Project Overview

ThoughtCatcher6 is an AI-enhanced mind mapping application built on the MERN stack, designed to transform chaotic ideas into structured plans through intelligent organization and collaboration features.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 Complete (MERN Foundation) | Phase 2 In Progress (Canvas Implementation)

## 🎯 Key Features

- **AI-Enhanced Organization**: Intelligent idea structuring and layout optimization
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user mind mapping with live updates
- **Flexible Export Options**: Preserve structure across multiple formats
- **Intuitive Canvas Interface**: Drag-and-drop node creation and connection
- **Advanced Node Management**: Rich content, attachments, and hierarchical organization

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with SVG canvas rendering
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js API
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user management
