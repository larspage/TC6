# ThoughtCatcher6 - Deployment Notes

## Critical Security Updates Required Before Production

### 🔒 Password Security
**PRIORITY: HIGH**

Currently using simple password requirements for development ease:
- Minimum 6 characters
- No complexity requirements
- No special character requirements

**Before Production Deployment:**
1. **Increase minimum password length to 12+ characters**
2. **Require password complexity:**
   - At least 1 uppercase letter
   - At least 1 lowercase letter  
   - At least 1 number
   - At least 1 special character
3. **Add password strength validation on frontend**
4. **Consider implementing:**
   - Password history (prevent reuse of last 5 passwords)
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Password expiration policies

### 📝 Implementation Location
- **Backend validation**: `server/routes/api/users.js` (line ~32)
- **Frontend validation**: `client/src/components/auth/Register.js`
- **User model**: `server/src/models/User.js` (line ~20)

### 🧪 Current Development Users
**Sample users for testing (REMOVE before production):**
- john@example.com / password123
- jane@example.com / mypass456

### 🔐 Additional Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement HTTPS in production
- [ ] Add CORS configuration for production domains
- [ ] Set secure JWT secret (not in .env.example)
- [ ] Add input sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add audit logging for authentication events
- [ ] Consider implementing 2FA for enhanced security

### 🚀 Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Update password requirements
- [ ] Remove sample users
- [ ] Update JWT secret
- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Set up HTTPS
- [ ] Configure CORS for production
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Security audit of authentication system
