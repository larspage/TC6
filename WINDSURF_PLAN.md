# ThoughtCatcher6 - WindSurfer Project Plan

## Notes
**Project**: AI-Enhanced Mind Mapping Application (MERN Stack)
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete (Foundation) | Phase 2 In Progress (Canvas Implementation)
**Migration**: Transitioning from Cursor to WindSurfer development environment

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Stack**: MongoDB + Express.js + React 18+ + Node.js
- **Canvas**: SVG-based rendering for mind map visualization
- **Auth**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Storage**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for data persistence
- **Frontend**: Component-based React architecture with hooks

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ MERN stack foundation established
- ✅ Basic canvas prototype with node creation/editing
- ✅ Manual connection drawing between nodes
- ✅ Drag-and-drop functionality for node positioning
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations for nodes and connections
- ✅ Project structure and component organization
- ✅ Database models (MindMap, Node, Connection, User)
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints foundation

### Key Bottlenecks Identified
- Auto-save backend integration incomplete
- User authentication UI not implemented
- Development tools (ESLint, Prettier) not configured
- Export functionality missing
- Advanced node features pending

## Task List

### Phase 2 Completion (Current Priority)
- [ ] Complete auto-save backend integration
- [ ] Implement user authentication UI (login/register forms)
- [ ] Add advanced node management features
- [ ] Implement connection rerouting on node movement
- [ ] Add node styling and customization options

### Phase 3: MVP Core Features
- [ ] Implement export functionality (PNG, JSON formats)
- [ ] Add mind map sharing and collaboration basics
- [ ] Implement data persistence and offline capabilities
- [ ] Add search and filtering for nodes
- [ ] Create comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
- [ ] AI-powered auto-layout and organization
- [ ] Real-time collaboration with WebSockets
- [ ] Advanced export options (PDF, structured documents)
- [ ] Rich node content (attachments, images, links)
- [ ] Version control and history tracking

### Development Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [ ] Set up Git hooks for automated testing
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

### Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Update API documentation with current endpoints
- [ ] Create user guide and tutorials
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Prepare production deployment guide

## Current Goal
Complete Phase 2 by implementing auto-save backend integration and user authentication UI to achieve a fully functional MVP foundation.

## Success Metrics
- Users can create, edit, and automatically save mind maps
- Secure user authentication and session management
- Smooth canvas interactions with real-time updates
- Reliable data persistence across sessions
- Clean, maintainable codebase ready for advanced features
