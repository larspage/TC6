◦
Hierarchical Relationship Establishment: Support the creation of clear hierarchical relationships between nodes, forming the essential tree structure of a mind map.
◦
Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Implement intuitive drag-and-drop capabilities for arranging nodes and branches, allowing for quick idea capture.
◦
Basic Customization: Offer basic options to change the color of nodes or branches (especially for main topics) and provide basic text formatting (e.g., bold, italics) to aid organization and visual clarity.
◦
Manual Connection Drawing: Users should be able to manually draw connections between any two nodes, allowing for flexible representation of relationships.
2.
Saving and Loading
◦
Cloud Storage: All created mind maps must be saved to a cloud storage mechanism to ensure persistence and accessibility from different devices.
◦

Basic Sharing: Allow users to share their mind maps with others, initially with view-only or limited collaborative access.
◦
Image Export: Provide the ability to export mind maps as static image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
◦
Basic Text Outline Export: Enable export of the mind map content as a simple text outline or list.
4.
User Interface & Ease of Use
◦
Intuitive Interface: The application must feature an intuitive and simple interface to ensure a minimal learning curve.

AI Idea Generation: Implement AI capabilities to generate initial ideas or suggest new branches based on a central topic or existing content.
◦
AI Auto-Expansion of Branches: Enable AI to automatically expand branches with related concepts or deeper levels of detail.
◦
AI Content Recommendations: Offer AI-driven suggestions for relevant content, links, or external resources based on node content.
◦
AI Smart Formatting & Organization: Utilize AI to automatically apply optimal formatting, arrangement, and even anticipate and map thoughts to streamline the organization process.
◦
AI Voice/Text Input: Allow users to convert spoken words or free-form text inputs directly into nodes or structured map elements.
◦
AI Summarization: Integrate AI to summarize text content within nodes or branches, or to generate task descriptions from brainstorming sessions.
3.
Enhanced Collaboration
◦
