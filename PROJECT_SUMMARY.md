# ThoughtCatcher6 - Project Summary

## Overview
AI-Enhanced Mind Mapping Application built on MERN stack to transform chaotic ideas into structured plans through intelligent organization and collaboration features.

## Target Users
- **Individuals**: Personal organization, productivity, creative work
- **Business Professionals**: Project management, strategic planning, consulting
- **Educators/Students**: Teaching, learning, information organization
- **Designers/Engineers**: Technical diagramming, workflow visualization
- **Specialists**: Negotiators, mediators, users with learning differences

## Core Value Proposition
Addresses key pain points in existing mind mapping tools:
- Poor auto-layout systems â†’ AI-powered intelligent organization
- Limited collaboration â†’ Real-time multi-user capabilities
- Poor export options â†’ Structure-preserving export formats
- Cluttered interfaces â†’ Clean, intuitive canvas design

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with SVG canvas rendering
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js RESTful API
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user management

### Data Models
- **MindMap**: Title, description, user ID, canvas settings
- **Node**: Text content, position, styling, hierarchical relationships
- **Connection**: Links between nodes with styling information
- **User**: Authentication details and personal information

### Key API Endpoints
- **Auth**: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/forgot-password`
- **Mind Maps**: CRUD operations on `/mindmaps`
- **Nodes**: CRUD operations on `/nodes`
- **Connections**: CRUD operations on `/connections`
- **Export**: `/mindmaps/:id/export/{png|json}`

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETE
